    "\"Overfitting\" is defined when a model  captures \"patterns\" in the training data that do not repeat in new data. Thus, if a model has a significantly high accuracy on training dataset, following by a much smaller accuracy test dataset, we can conclude that model has a high extent for overfiting.\n",
    "\n",
    "For logistic regression, the accuracy for training dataset (around 66%) is higher than that for test dataset (around 65.96%). This indicates that the logistic regression has achieved a nearly match accuracy when learnining the model from training dataset and use it on dataset, demonstrating a moderate overfitting level\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, for random forest classifier, the accuracy for training dataset (around 97.7%) is higher than that for test dataset (around 90%). Moreover, the surge in accuracy from training dataset to test dataset is more comparable in random forest classifier (around 97.7%-88.8%=9%) compared to logistic regression model (around 66%-65.96%=0.04%). This significant weight on training dataset accuracy (nearly perfect) demonstrate a higher overfitting rate compared to logistic regression\n",

    "Comparing between the 2 classifiers, we can observe that logistic regression has a lower accuracy in test dataset (about 65%) compared to random forest classifier (around 88.8%).

    "The presence of nonlinearities in the dataset reduces the accuracy of the logistic regression classifier while random forest classifier is not affected. This is because logistic regression is a linear classifier, which computes a straight-line decision boundary to separate and classify data. However, where data points are not perfectly separable, this classifier results in low accuracy (for example a data labelled \"A\" is classified as \"B\" when it lies in the \"A\" area separable by decision boundary).\n",
    "\n",
    "Conversely, the random forest classifier is capable of capturing isolated points with less extreme classification probabilities. Naturally, random forest classifier ensembles approach, which combines multiple smaller classifiers from each decision tree, results in a complex decision boundary that effectively captures the nonlinear data. Thus, it provides a more flexible decision boundary by averaging multiple decision trees, which helps in capturing the overall structure of the data, including nonlinearities. In short, the accuracy of this classifier is not related to the nonlinear property of the dataset, making it a more reliable model for prediction in this case.\n",
